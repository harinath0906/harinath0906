### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist, I can get my head around complex concepts and implement them with ease. I belive building things is the easiest way to learn. My GitHub is a naive effort of showcasing some of my works.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various deep learning related projects to hone my skills and understand the application of data science in the real world.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing my Master of Data Science from The University of Sydney and will be completing it in Dec-2020.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work and collaborate on industry related data science projects.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about computer vision, NLP and statistics.
